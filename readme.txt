In the folder you should find a ipynb as well as a utils.py, a test.py file and a saved model.

- Notebook (ipynb): The notebook containing the analysis. Contains commentary so hopefully it should make reading the code easier. 
- utils (.py): File containing the utility functions used throughout the analysis 
- tests (.py): File containing some tests for the analysis 
- saved model (JSON): JSON file of the best model that has been saved. 

## How to run the the code ##Â 

To run the code, check that 'training' is False so that you can run the notebook from the top through to bottom and it will skip the model training procedure and load in the best model and run the evaluations.
